# Macintosh SE/30 Analog Board Schematic

The original scan of this schematic wasn't great. It was very blurry and had a lot of artifacts on it, and the scan itself was in two pieces. I tidied it up a bit and combined the two original scans into one. It's still not super-legible, but I think it's a lot easier to understand than when it was in two pieces.
